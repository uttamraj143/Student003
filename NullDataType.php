/*
 * -------------------------------NULL Data Type-----------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.

Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.

Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:

 */


$x = "Hello world!";
$x = null;//We are making x as empty using null
var_dump($x);




/*
 *  OUTPUT: 	NULL    As x varialbe is empty it will  show as with the Data type of x variable.So we made x variable to Null so the output is null
 */
