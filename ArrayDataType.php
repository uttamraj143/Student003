/*
 * --------------------------------ARRAY Data Type------------------------------------------
 * 
 *        An array stores multiple values in one single variable.
 *        An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

           If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
           
           
           In PHP, there are three types of arrays:

				-Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
				-Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
				-Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays
 * 
 * We will learn In details in later sessions.

$cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");//We are assigning 3 values to a car variable.Using array we can do that.
var_dump($cars);






/*
 * 
 * OUTPUT: 	array(3) { [0]=> string(5) "Volvo" [1]=> string(3) "BMW" [2]=> string(6) "Toyota" }
